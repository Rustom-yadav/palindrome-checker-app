# 🔁 Palindrome Checker App

A lightweight, logic-driven **Palindrome Checker Application** built to validate strings by comparing forward and reverse character sequences.

This project emphasizes **algorithmic thinking**, **input normalization**, and **clear conditional logic**, making it ideal for demonstrating core JavaScript fundamentals.

---

## 🎯 Objective

The purpose of this application is to:
- Identify whether a given input is a palindrome
- Normalize user input for accurate comparison
- Practice string manipulation and condition checks
- Build a clean, user-friendly validation flow

Simple problem. Strong logical signal.

---

## ✨ Key Features

- Real-time palindrome validation
- Case-insensitive and whitespace-safe logic
- Instant result feedback
- Clean and readable JavaScript implementation
- Fully client-side execution

---

## 🧱 Tech Stack

- HTML5 — input and structure
- CSS3 — layout and visual clarity
- JavaScript (Vanilla) — string processing logic

No dependencies. No abstraction overhead.

---

## 📁 Project Structure

index.html  — Main HTML file with input form  
styles.css  — Basic styling for layout  
script.js   — Core palindrome checking logic
README.md    — Project documentation
LICENSE      — Licensing information
.gitignore   — Git ignore rules


Optimized for readability and maintainability.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. User enters a string
2. Input is normalized (case and spacing handled)
3. String is reversed and compared
4. Result is displayed instantly

This reflects real-world validation workflows.
